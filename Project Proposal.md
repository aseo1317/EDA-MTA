**Question:**

Where can we place your street team to maximize number of signatures of people who are not only likely to be interested in WTWY but also more importantly likely to contribute to the cause?

The exploration of this question benefits you (WTWY International) best utilize your resource of the street team with the goals of raising awareness and fundraising

**Data Description:**

We will be using at least three months of MTA subway data in the form of turnstile information, which is freely available online for public use. This data is given in the form of a single turnstile's activity, delineated by station. The information given is four hours worth of data updated with the **total** number of entries and exits. With this information, we can deduce which stations have the most overall flow of traffic and even drill down into times of day and days of week with the most flow. With this data, I believe gathering geographic and demographic information could be prudent to maximize the types of people that are most likely to come to the gala. A single unit of data is most likely to be in the form of a train station's entries and exits by day. 

In addition to turnstile data, we may want to look into New York City tourism patterns by time of year, which could influence our deductions to place the street team at certain stations (e.g. Times Square). Further data sources to consider are census data, covid vaccination data, and the median age of neighborhoods if that is available. 

**Tools:**

We will be using both SQL and Python to gather and sort the turnstile data into a form that is easier to analyze. Then, we will be using Matlab for visualization of this analysis. 


**MVP Goal:**

At minimum, we should be able to provide you the data of which stations have the most traffic over a period of time (day, week) so that you can start positioning your street team accordingly.
